        <h3>A word from the founder.</h3>
        <p>"My name is Natsir and I live with my family in a small village called Rembon - about 8km away from Makale, the main town in <a href="#tanatoraja" class="in-text-link">Tana Toraja</a>. 
        I am an organic farmer and an English teacher. I teach farming in the local elemantary and highschools and also run a free <a href="english-school.html" class="in-text-link">Nature School</a> 
        (where we teach English and run classes on the environment, arts & crafts, music, etc...) for kids living in the surrounding villages. Growing up we never had enough, so I had to work
        really hard since I was a child. I haven't had the opportunity to get proper education, to play with friends or do sports. This experience taught me a lot and now, when I have enough 
        to feed my family, I want to share and give back to the community. I don't want other kids to experience what I had to. Since 2014 I have been involving 
        <a href="volunteering.html" class="in-text-link">volunteers</a> in my project. It is thanks to them that the project continues to move forward. I am also very appreciative of 
        the <a href="garden.html#funding" class="in-text-link">financial support</a> that keeps us going."</p>

        <h3>Experience our way of living with nature.</h3>
        <p>As true Torajans we appreciate everything that this land can give us. In our garden grow plenty of native fruit trees, vegetables and herbs, that we know to process in various 
        different ways. We would be delighted to show you the art of roasting authentic <a href="workshops.html#coffee" class="in-text-link">Torajan Coffee</a>, of creating delicious 
        <a href="workshops.html#chocolate" class="in-text-link">Chocolate</a> from our home-grown cacao beans and of cooking traditional 
        <a href="workshops.html#cooking" class="in-text-link">Torajan Meals</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>Our property is a central social point for the community. We are situated right next to a small mosque and frequenly call their kind visitors our guests. Friends and family members
        come and go in this big fluent household. In the course of the years we managed to build several gazebos and cabins that serve as classrooms for the 
        <a href="english-school.html" class="in-text-link">English classes</a> and as accomodation for <a href="volunteering.html" class="in-text-link">volunteers</a> and 
        foreign guests. If you want to be part of this colourful and pulsating, yet simple, life, we invite you to check out our 
        <a href="homestay.html" class="in-text-link">homestay</a> offers.

        <h3>Our paradise: The Highlands of Tana Toraja.</h3>
        <p>With its unique culture and geography, Tana Toraja in central Sulawesi simply has to be on your bucket list. Our farm is surrounded by forest, home to many different bird 
        species, and at night the crickets's rythmic cirping lulls us to sleep. In each direction the mountains of Toraja create the most amazing scenery. They can be admired from
        afar, climbed in a challenging day-hike or experienced as a camping adventure. Wherever we go, the traditional Tongkonans are our constant companion. Visit the world-famous burial
        ceremonies, predominantly held in December, observe rice farming, wait patiently for a buffalo to clear the road and listen to local legends and stories. We are more than 
        happy to give you reccommendations to make your visit the most unique experience in Indonesia. Just ask.
