        <h3>Where our guests stay</h3>
        <p>We built several bamboo bungalows surrounded by native forest and our organic <a href="garden.html" class="in-text-link">garden</a>. Each bungalow has two double 
          rooms with separate entrances and and a spacious front porch. Be aware that we live a very authentic lifestyle, and so our washing and bathroom facilities are very simple.
        <p>We particularly invite families with children to stay with us as guests. Our granddaugher, the six-year old Adiba, would love some companions while strolling 
          through the garden, playing games or attending <a href="english-school.html" class="in-text-link">English class</a>. </p>
        <h4>Accommodation Details</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Double rooms, with queen-sized bed, small table and mosquito netting</li>

        </ul>
        <p>We are currently still in the process of figuring out all the details for hosting guests, but please feel free to <a href="contact.html" class="in-text-link">contact</a> 
        us with any questions and inquiries. As soon as we set up our profile on a booking website, we will add a link in here.</p>

        <h3>What there is to do</h3>
        <p>Apart from the organic <a href="workshops.html" class="in-text-link">workshops</a> which we offer right here on our property, Tana Toraja has a lot to offer to both nature and culture
        enthusiasts. To visit the villages and observe traditional living styles, it just takes stepping out from the property and walking in any direction that the road allows. The people in 
        the villages are exceptionally friendly and a 'hello' goes a long way. Oftentimes curiosity overturns language barriers and photo requests are frequent.</p>
        <p>More typical tourist attractions include visiting the gigantic Jesus statue on Burake Hill, hiking up to several viewpoints along the main road
        between Makale and Rantepao to admire the vastness of the Torajan Highlands, or visiting tourist villages, burial sites and the traditional houses (Tongkonans). There is an abundance of local guides, that are more than welcome to teach you about customs and traditions.</p>
        <p>For those preferring more physically activities, there is a variety of hiking trails around, and renting
        out camping equipment is very common. While the dry season offers more time in the day for outdoor activities, the rain season turns this country into a green paradise.</p>

        <h3>How to get around</h3>
        <p>Our <a href="contact.html" class="in-text-link">home</a> is located in the village Maroson, about 8 kilometers west of Makale. Be aware, there is no public transport. You can reach us from Makassar by long-distance 
        bus to Makale terminal. From there you will have to go by car or scooter. It is reccommended to rent your own transport in Makale, such that you are free to leave wherever you want without
        relying on asking for a ride. Ask us for reccommendations for rental companies, details on bus services or anything else.
