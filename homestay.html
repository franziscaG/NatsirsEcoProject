        <p>We love our life. We live it to the fullest, even though it is incredibly simple. We also love having guests over, share with them our home and food and stories. We welcome

        <h3>Where our guests stay</h3>
        <p>We have several bamboo houses at the end of our property surrounded by native forest and our <a href="garden.html#garden" class="in-text-link">organic garden</a>. Each cabin is equipped with 
        either a double or single bed, mosquito netting and a spacious front porch. We live a very authentic, hence very simple, lifestyle and invite our guests to share it with us. 
        Washing and bathroom facilities are traditional Indonesian with squat-down toilets and cold showers. Coming directly from different hygienic standards might need some getting used
        to but we are confident you will manage.</p>
        <p>We particularly invite families with children to stay with us as guests. Our youngest family member, the six-year old Adiba, would love some companions while strolling 
        through the garden, playing games or attending English class. </p>
        <p>We are currently still in the process of figuring out all the details for hosting guests, but please feel free to <a href="contact.html" class="in-text-link">contact</a> 
        us with any questions and inquiries. As soon as we set up our profile on a booking website, we will add a link in here.</p>

        <h3>What we offer</h3>
        <p>You are invited to roam the garden as much as you want, listen in to English classes and ask us as many questions as you want. We provide you with drinking water, mechanically
        filtered and boiled to make sterile, and if you wish we will provide you with up to three authentic meals a day. If you wish to learn how to cook Torajan dishes you are most welcome to 
        sign up for a <a href="workshops.html#cooking" class="in-text-link">cooking class</a>. If you want to learn more about making chocolate from our cacao beans and roasting coffee, come and join our
        <a href="workshops.html#chocolate" class="in-text-link">chocolate</a> and <a href="workshops.html#coffee" class="in-text-link">coffee</a> workshops.

        <h3>What you can do here</h3>
        <p>Apart from the organic <a href="workshops.html" class="in-text-link">workshops</a> we offer right here on our property, Tana Toraja has a lot to offer to both nature and culture
        enthusiasts. To visit the villages and observe traditional living styles, it just takes stepping out from the property and walking in any direction that the road allows. The people in 
        the villages are exceptionally friendly and a 'hello' goes a long way. Oftentimes curiosity overturns language barriers and photo requests are frequent.</p>
        <p>More typical tourist attractions include visiting the gigantic Jesus statue on Burake Hill overlooking the city, hiking up to one of several other viewpoints along the main road
        between Makale and Rantepao to admire the vastness of the Torajan Highlands, or visiting tourist villages, burial sites and the traditional houses (Tongkonans) marked as "Wisata" on 
        any map. There is an abundance of local guides, that are more than welcome to teach you about customs and traditions. Be aware that while the majority of Torajans are Christians,
        there is also a significant number of Muslims here (including us).</p>
        <p>For those preferring more physically challenging activities, there is a variety of hiking trails around, and renting
        out camping equipment is very common. Long treks like Mount Sesean, Mount Karua and Mount Rantemaria (highest peak in Sulawesi) are best approached in the dry season, and, for those 
        unexperienced, with a guide. While the dry season offers more time in the day for outdoor activities, the rain season turns this country into a green paradise. There
        are still enough dry hours in the day to satisfy restless souls. </p>

        <h3>How to get around</h3>
        <p>Our home is located in a village belonging to Rembon, about 8 kilometer west of Makale. Be aware, there is no public transport. You can reach us from Makassar either by long-distance 
        bus to Makale terminal (examples of bus companies are Sina Mudar, ???). If you wish to drive around frequently it would be reccommended to rent motorbikes/scooters in Makale. There 
        are also rental cars available but depending on the remoteness of the activities you would like to do, the roads to them might be not good enough for a car. In any case, we are happy to 
        help you with organizing transport.
