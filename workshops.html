        <p>Our garden is 100% organic and beautifully wild. We love taking care of our trees and plants and our crops are of fantastic quality. It took some time and effort to 
          figure out the best ways to process our fruit and vegetables, and while we're still aiming to improve, we have found unique ways that fit our lifestyle.

        <h3>Organic Chocolate Workshop</h3>
        <p>Have you always wanted to find out how to make chocolate from scratch? In our nature garden we grow a large variety
            of organic cacao trees. We will explain to you how to grow the trees, how to harvest the fruit and how to process them. 
            Depending on the season, you can either try it yourself or we will work with the fruits and beans from the last harvest.
            The beans have to get roasted, crushed, heated and mashed. Choose your favourite flavour like organic cinnamon,
            salt or homegrown chilli and add it to your own chocolate. Taste it and wrap it in small bamboo parcels, perfect as a 
            snack or souvenir.
