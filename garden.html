        <h3>Our plants and trees</h3>
        <p>When we initiated his project, the hill upon wich the house is built, was only rock and the occasional pine tree. Pine trees are excellent in breaking up the 
        rock but also a very dominant species, taking up a lot of sunlight, space and nutrition. As a result nothing else can grow between them; except for pineapple, apparently, sneaky little
        buggars! In order to make this ground fertile, the rock had to be turned into viable soil. It took many years, but slowly large parts of the property started to sprout native fruit
        trees, medicinal shrubs and leafy vegetables. The place is still wild. Grown on the principle of multi-species farming to improve plant resiliance and eco-diversity, the garden has
        still the aesthetics of a forest. Under the green thumb of Mr. Natsir, tediously raising new seedlings and replanting them, the garden keeps growing continuouly.</p>
        <p>The main players in this micro-ecosystem are cacao and coffee. Thought to be the staple products in this project, hundreds of individual trees are spread about the area and thrive
        particularly well in this tropical climate. We have found unique ways to process their beans and offer our knowledge in form of <a href="workshops.html" class="in-text-link">Workshops</a> to the general public.
        In the near future, we hope to establish a local business selling our home-made chocolate and coffee to both tourists and retailers in the vicinity. 
        On top of that a variety of fruit trees, like Lime, Rambutan, Pomela, Ambrella, Banana (who is technically a grass), Tomarillo and many more, provide fresh 
        produce all year long. Some of the herbs and spices are very seasonal, like pepper and chilli, but many more, like cinnamon (from the bark of the tree), ginger, tumeric and lemongrass 
        are available all year round and are plentyful. We are big tee-drinkers and we call our favorite blend 'Crazy Tea'. </p>
        <p>Our heart is with the plants and we enjoy so much growing them that we can't keep up with consuming our crops. In an effort to encourage our neighbours and friends to start their
        own gardens, we readily distribute seeds, seedlings and extra produce, together with instructions on how to take care of them. For those interested in helping out with the never-ending
        garden work, check out our <a href="volunteering.html" class="in-text-link">volunteering</a> opportunities.</p>

        <h3>Farming classes</h3>
        <p>One of our main objectives is to turn the local community's focus back from industrial towards individual organic farming. We strongly believe that organic crops are healthier both
        for consumption as well as for the plants themselves. Therefore, frequently, Mr. Natsir gives inoffical classes on growing, harvesting and processing specific plants to those who 
        seek that knowledge. </p>
        <p>We also aim our teaching efforts towards highschool students which are close to graduation, in order to provide them with the basic understanding to operate their own garden 
        initiatives one day, and perhaps, even make a living out of it. The classes, almost equally inofficial due to the constant opposition of the conservative education system, are given 
        at the local highschool. Together with the students, we have created a school garden, growing ginger, tumeric, pumkin and others. It is our hope that these extracurriculars will one 
        day be recognized by the school authorities, their worth, both monetary as well as educational, taken as incentive to integrate our classes into the standard syllabus. </p>
        <p>Enlargening our target audience we would love to offer university internships, directed at those students occupying themselves with agricultural and farming studies. As a first
        point of contact, Makale university would be perfect. However, this is still a work in progress.

        <h3>How we fund ourselves. </h3>
        <p>Funding has always been a sensitive topic. As mentioned, our heart lies with the garden and the <a href="english-school.html" class="in-text-link">children</a> and we wished deeply that we could live on 
        love and air. Alas, we can't. It needs this big family to run the whole place; it needs constant renovation and improvement. We need building supplies, tools, teaching materials, food,
        and a lot of water. This year the dry season took a few weeks longer and in lack of a constant water supply, some of the garden suffered already. <a href="volunteering.html" class="in-text-link">volunteers</a>
        can help by investing their time, tourists can help by taking part in our <a href="workshops.html" class="in-text-link">Workshops</a> or immerge themselves into our authentic 
        lifestyle by booking a <a href="homestay.html" class="in-text-link">Homestay</a>. Everyone else is invited to spread our story via 
        <a href="contact.html" class="in-text-link">social media</a>. Only in the end, we ask you to check out our fundraising campains. </p>
