# NatsirsEcoProject
This is an attempt to built a (static) website for Natsir Eco School. Built step by step using GitHub Pages.

Live site: 
https://franziscag.github.io/NatsirsEcoProject/home

If you want to work on the website, contact me on franzisca.gorniacyzk@gmail.com

Later to be moved to its own domain.

Description: I started the project to account for the lack of information about the touristy aspects of Natsir Eco School. They have a whatsapp contact with some old flyers about 
the workshops they offer, but I was thinking that if there are any tourists like me (anyone from Europe, I guess), they would love to know the details about the workshops before they
even get in contact, to know if it's worth it. I want the website to be visible when searching for Natsir Eco School, and connected to the Google Maps Profile, connected to the 
Instagram and Facebook, and vice versa, so everything is consistently linked. It should explain the workshops but also offer the opportunity to add additional enterprises in the 
future like homestays. It should also inform about the background of the project, the garden, the English classes, the farming classes, the volunteering, expalain what the money
is good for and why it is needed.
