# NatsirsEcoProject
This is an attempt to built a (static) website for Natsir Eco School. Built step by step using GitHub Pages.

Live site: 
https://natsireco.org

If you want to work on the website, contact Irma on the website and ask for Franzisca Gorniacyzk

Description: I started the project to account for the lack of information about the touristy aspects of Natsir Eco School. They have a whatsapp contact with some old flyers about 
the workshops they offer, but I was thinking that if there are any tourists like me (anyone from Europe, I guess), they would love to know the details about the workshops before they
even get in contact, to know if it's worth it. I want the website to be visible when searching for Natsir Eco School, and connected to the Google Maps Profile, connected to the 
Instagram and Facebook, and vice versa, so everything is consistently linked. It should explain the workshops but also offer the opportunity to add additional enterprises in the 
future like homestays. It should also inform about the background of the project, the garden, the English classes, the farming classes, the volunteering, expalain what the money
is good for and why it is needed.

Jobs to do in the future:
    1. Add a family picture in the about section.
    2. add more 'loose' pictures on each page, like a collection
    3. add the chocolate business as it's own page, like 'local business', when it's up and running. Add text, photos, can use any other page as template. They are all the same (except the contact/ About us page)
    4. add stuff in Indonesian, I'm thinking particularly the homestay and workshop section, although they can be simply translated. Perhaps add a language selection button? the only thing that 
    is potentially different, is the volunteering sections...
    5. Merge Google business profiles. Three is two too many. Google/AI how to do that. 
    6. Link website to instagram (both Natsir initiatives as well as Natsir eco school). Btw the IG link on the website goes to the eco school.
    7. Link website on facebook, workaway and worldpeckers.
