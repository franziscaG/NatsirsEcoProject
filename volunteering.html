        <h3>International Volunteers</h3>
        <p>Our project is non-profit and based on the principles of learning, sharing and empowering. We offer a caring and friendly environment and are open to you helping us in ways 
        that interest you and that match your abilities. The help needed whilst you're here is a mixture of working in the <a href="garden.html#garden" class="in-text-link">garden</a> 
        and teaching English in our <a href="english-school.html" class="in-text-link">Eco School</a>.</p>
        <p>While staying with us, we will provide you with three delicious, healthy meals each day (vegans and vegetarians are easily 
        accommodated). You will have the choice of staying in one of the bamboo bungalows overlooking the garden. We provide you with a mattress, a mosquito net, electricity and warm sheets 
        and pillows. See also the information on our <a href="homestay.html" class="in-text-link">Homestay</a> page to get a picture of this place.</p>
        <p>Find out details, feedback from previous volunteers and many more pictures on <a href="#work-exchange" class="in-text-link">Workaway and Worldpackers</a>.</p>

        <h3>The help we need</h3> 
        <p>The garden work involves planting, digging ponds, building paths, harvesting turmeric, coffee and cocoa. Plus whatever is needed for the project at the time! When teaching the 
          local children, please feel free to incorporate your own ideas. Although we have a book here that collects the ideas of our past volunteers, teaching ideas 
          seem to work best when the teacher has ownership of the creative input. </p>
        <p>Volunteers can get also join in making our own chocolate and coffee. While we are still perfecting our recipees, we hope that in the future the sale of these products can help fund 
          our project. Other activities that could use support are our efforts in community development and bamboo crafting.</p>
