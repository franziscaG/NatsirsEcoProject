        <p> We want to give the local children those opportunities that we struggled so hard to achieve when we were young. Giving free English classes was a straightforward decision that 
          we haven't regretted for a single second. We enjoy seeing our youth interacting confidently with foreigners, become part of this international world.

        <h3>English classes with international teachers</h3>
        <p>Teaching the young children English is one of our main objectives. We believe that a knowledge of this global language will serve them significantly in their future lives. Already
        now, a large percentage of Toraja's economy is based on international tourism and the job market in the branch is growing rapidly. However, here, in the remote jungle of central 
        Sulawesi, the rest of the world is incredibly far away and awareness for the significance of globalization staggerinly low. To bring the reality of a world-outside into the 
        children's minds we are thrilled to have a constant flow of international <a href="volunteering.html" class="in-text-link">volunteers</a>, who are willing to offer their time and 
        knowledge to their pupils. Being confronted with different cultures, learning new ways of communicating and playing games, the children are visibly enjoying the classes, which are 
        entirely voluntary for them. </p>

        <h3>Organic Farming classses</h3>
        <p>Many teenagers here in Toraja, at the end of highschool, are unsure at what to do with their lives. We want to give them opportunities outside of the traditional job market. In an 
        effort to create awareness both for the environment and the tourism industry we offer different classes that cover organic farming and English for working in tourism. The topics in our
        farming classes include growing, harvesting and processing of native crops. The students can get hands-on experience in our organic <a href="garden.html" class="in-text-link">garden</a>. The topics in the English classes are focused on the 
        interaction with tourists.

        <h3>Get involved </h3>
        <p>Our connection to the land runs deep. We often grow more than we can consume and gladly share seeds, seedlings, and harvests with neighbors and friends.
          For those interested in sustainable farming, organic gardening, or teaching English, we warmly invite you to explore our 
          <a href="volunteering.html" class="in-text-link">volunteering</a> opportunities.</p>

        <p>Apart from the volunteers, our project depends on outside support. The profits from the <a href="workshops.html" class="in-text-link">Workshops</a> and <a href="homestay.html" class="in-text-link">Homestay</a> guests directly fund the costs to run the 
          Eco school. Spreading our story on <a href="contact.html" class="in-text-link">social media</a> is thus an 
          essential contribution to our project's wellfaring. </p>
          
        <p>All other expenses, like building renovations, watering systems and extra tools and materials have to be covered externally by fundraising campains. We appreciate every 
          little contribution that can help us advance the children's prospectives in our tiny part of the world.</p>
